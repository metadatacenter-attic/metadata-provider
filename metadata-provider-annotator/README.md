# Metadata Annotation Pipeline

This folder contains the scripts used to build our prototype metadata-annotation functionality and to apply it to a subset of metadata records in the NCBI BioSample repository.

The contents of this folder and the annotation process are described in detail in [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/metadatacenter/metadata-provider/blob/master/metadata-provider-annotator/translator-demo.ipynb).
